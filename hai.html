    <body><b><u>HTML5</u></b></h1><p>Hello World.HTML5 is a software solution stack that defines the properties and behaviors of web page content by implementing a markup-based pattern to it.</p>

     <h2><p><i>  HTML5 was the fifth and last major version of HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is maintained by a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).</h2></p></i> 
        
       <h3> HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[3] with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.[2][4] Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.[5]</h3></body>
